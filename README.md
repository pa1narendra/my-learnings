## Day 1  - 25/8/2024
Today's sunday so I didn't learn much , but not zero, I came to know that there is bank called `State Street` which is bigger than some of the largest banks and banking companies that I know. I know about `BNY Mellon`, `JP Morgan`, `Goldmann Sachs` but the fact that it is even bigger than all of these makes me feel wondered.

## Day 2  - 26/8/2024

Today I came to know that there is this library (it's not a library but a feature) called `confetti` which has an onclick function that explodes some emojis of our choice into our webpage from bothsides and we can use it as button in our project or site , it is nice to see the effect. We can even customize it further, like we can increase or decrease the number of emojis that appear when we click on that button , or we can increase or decrease the size of emojis, we can add or remove the type of emojis to appear.

This is a demo of that feature.
